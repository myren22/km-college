		It is tragic occurrence when wandering through our great nation and one sees the most<br>
		terrible of things. Ugly babies. They simply pollute our well made roads and city<br>
		blocks with their presence. It is to this end that I propose a solution to remedy this<br>
		most unfortunate of problems. Instead of having these infants be a leach on our cities<br>
		maintenance, we shall utilize them in adding to our cities food supplies

		"I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that<br>
		a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing,<br>
		and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt <br>
		that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout."
